## Course Description

As LLM-based apps proliferate, many function as thin veneers around more robust models such as GPT. In this course, instructor Laurence Moroney demonstrates the basics of building your own LLM-powered app and controlling how it works from the back end. Get an introduction to some of the basic use cases of LLMs in application development. Basic knowledge of Python, Node.js, and LLMs is required. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be prepared to create an ops ecosystem whose core functionality is based on an LLM.
